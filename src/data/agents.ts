    bio: `Hi, I'm Momma D, a TikTok agent, CEO of The Reservation, and a proud member of the Royals Bloodline Agency.

I've spent the past year helping creators grow on TikTok, and I bring over 5 years of experience in social media to the table.

At heart, I'm a gamer and an anime lover—but what truly makes me happy is helping people level up.

Watching creators find their voice, build their platforms, and start monetizing their content is what fuels me every day.

I'm always looking for creators who are ready to reach the next level and want a mentor who will guide them the right way—through content, lives, branding, and monetization—without the fluff or fake promises.

At The Reservation, everyone is welcome—but we proudly cater to the weirdos, the puppets, and the beautifully odd. This isn't just a team—it's a community.

That's The Reservation.`,

We always put the creators first. We want you to succeed but you have to really want it and put in that work to help grow. How do you do that you may ask? Simply discover your "WHY?" Your "WHY?" will keep you motivated to keep going and to never give up. We will guide you with Tips, Tricks, Perks, Trainings. We also have the ability to message TikTok on behalf of the creator if your ban appeal is denied in the app. As long as its a legit false ban there is a good chance of overturning it and getting you back on that road to success, and having fun doing it. Perks are our Milestone Rewards for achieving a specific amount of diamonds in a single month and we gift you a gift reward in your live stream for this amazing achievement. Monthly Raffle for just going live and wracking up those hours. Rewards for winning in battle tournaments based on wins and some are based on total points. Possibilities to win trips from winning events. We have Rank Rewards for Live hosts and for Gamers. We also provide a incentive to creators by allowing creators to participate in the Scouting/recruiter program to have the potential to earn a commission for brining in New Creators. If your reaching for LIVE PRO BADGE we can help you apply when you get to that point as well Requirement is 10 million diamonds in the last 30 days and have at least 100 average concurrent viewers in the last 30 days or at least 100k followers. In order to have access to all these amazing perks you must hit those min requirements for going live monthly (explained below). I strive to maintain a positive environment for all creators. We have a ZERO TOLERANCE rule in New Beginnings so please if you join be respectful to others as you don't know what others are going through in their lives outside of TikTok. I welcome all creators from gamers, Furries, all VRChat players that stream on TikTok. Battlers, GRWM, podcasters, DV hosts, Mental Health hosts, Box Battlers, Hang out Boxes with friends, Chill with me streams, and more.
