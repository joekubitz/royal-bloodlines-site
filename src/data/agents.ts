    bio: `Hi, I'm Momma D, a TikTok agent, CEO of The Reservation, and a proud member of the Royal Bloodlines Agency.

I've spent the past year helping creators grow on TikTok, and I bring over 5 years of experience in social media to the table.

At heart, I'm a gamer and an anime lover—but what truly makes me happy is helping people level up.

Watching creators find their voice, build their platforms, and start monetizing their content is what fuels me every day.

I'm always looking for creators who are ready to reach the next level and want a mentor who will guide them the right way—through content, lives, branding, and monetization—without the fluff or fake promises.

At The Reservation, everyone is welcome—but we proudly cater to the weirdos, the puppets, and the beautifully odd. This isn't just a team—it's a community.

That's The Reservation.`,

    bio: `I’m Smokedsoul19, founder of Team Smoke—a growing collective built around passion, consistency, and respect for the grind. Team Smoke isn’t just a name; it’s a mindset. We move with confidence, support each other, and put in real work to level up together.
What started as a way to spend time with friends has become a team focused on creativity, community, and progression. Whether it’s gaming, content creation, streaming, Team Smoke is about showing up, improving your craft, and representing something bigger than yourself.
I’m looking for team members who are motivated, dependable, and hungry to grow. Skill matters, but mindset matters more. If you’re someone who:

Takes initiative


Communicates well


Supports teammates instead of competing with them


Is serious about improving over time


then you’ll fit right in.
Team Smoke is for people who want to build something meaningful—not chase shortcuts. If you’re ready to put in the work, represent the team with pride, and grow together, this might be your home.
